## General Info
This C++ project offers a diverse collection of image processing filters. These filters can be applied to images to perform various transformations and enhancements. Below is a list of the available filters:

## Languages Used
- C++

## Features

### Black & White Filter
The Black & White filter converts color images into grayscale, simplifying them to shades of gray for artistic effects or analysis.

### Invert Filter
The Invert filter transforms colors by replacing each pixel's color with its complementary color, creating intriguing visual changes.

### Merge Filter
The Merge filter combines multiple images into one, allowing for creative collages, overlays, or composite imagery.

### Flip Image
The Flip Image filter provides horizontal or vertical flips, useful for correcting orientation or adding visual interest.

### Darken and Lighten Image
These filters adjust image brightness. Darken reduces brightness, creating a darker image, while Lighten enhances brightness for exposure correction.

### Rotate Image
Rotate images clockwise or counterclockwise by a specified angle to align or adjust their orientation.

### Detect Image Edges
Edge Detection identifies object boundaries in an image, essential for object recognition and segmentation.

### Enlarge Image
Enlarge images while maintaining aspect ratios, ideal for scaling up images for printing or display.

### Shrink Image
Reduce image size while preserving aspect ratios for web use or conserving storage space.

### Mirror 1/2 Image
Mirror one-half of an image horizontally or vertically to correct distortions or create symmetry.

### Shuffle Image
Randomly rearrange pixels in an image for artistic and creative effects.

### Blur Image
Apply blurring to images, reducing sharpness and smoothing details for noise reduction or artistic soft focus.

### Save the Image to a File
After applying filters, save the modified image in BMP file for future use.
